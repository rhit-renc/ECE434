1. min voltage: -30mV, max voltage: 3.14V
2. frequency: 980mHz, period: 1.02s
3. blinkLED.sh uses between 0% and 1.3% of the CPU, usually hovering at around 0.6%
4. shortest period is around 17ms
5. the period is very unstable and can range from arounf 17ms to around 44ms
6. period is still unstable
7. Removing the setup code did not impact the period and removing the sleeps caused the period to look like noise
8. the shortest period I can get is around 17ms

1. 3.3kHz, 300us
2. 70% CPU usage
3. later

1. can't test as it blinks onboard LED
